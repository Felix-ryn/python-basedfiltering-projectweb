# 🧰 Python-Based Filtering Web Project

A lightweight and modular Python web application for content filtering. This project allows users to submit text or images through a web interface, which are then processed using customizable filtering rules such as blocklists, allowlists, or regular expressions. Designed for learning, prototyping, or microservice integration.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This application provides a user-friendly interface for submitting content and reviewing filtered results. Whether you're removing sensitive keywords from user input or pre-processing uploaded images, the project demonstrates a full-stack implementation of a filtering pipeline using Python and Flask.

### Core Features:
- ✂️ Text filtering using blocklists or regular expressions
- 🖼️ Optional image filtering (e.g., blur, detect)
- 🧠 Configurable and extendable filtering rules
- 🌐 Web-based submission and review interface

## 💡 Configuration

You can adjust the filtering rules in `filter_utils.py`. For example:
- Update `blocklist = [...]` to define filtered keywords
- Modify regex patterns or add new rules
- Enable/disable image filtering (e.g., blur, size limit)

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
pytest
```
